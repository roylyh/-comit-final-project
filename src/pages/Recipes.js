                                <span><p>1 Place cauliflower florets into TM bowl, and chop 10 sec/speed 5, or until ‘rice’ sized pieces. Place into Varoma dish, poking a hole in the centre to let the steam through. Set aside. Wash and dry TM bowl.<br />
                                    2 Place garlic, ginger, and chilli into TM bowl and chop 3 sec/speed 7.<br />
                                    3 Add onion and chop 2 sec/speed 5. Scrape down sides with spatula.<br />
                                    4 Add ghee or coconut oil, cinnamon, paprika, garam masala, cardamom, coriander, cumin, and turmeric, and cook 5 min/100/speed soft. Loosen mixture from sides and base of bowl with spatula.<br />
                                    5 Add coconut cream, lemon juice, tomato paste, salt and chicken to TM bowl. Place Varoma dish into position, and cook 25 min/Varoma/reverse/speed soft. Cauliflower rice will steam above, as butter chicken cooks below. Check cauliflower is cooked - if not, add another 5 mins/Varoma/reverse/speed soft.<br />
                                    6 Place cauliflower rice into a serving dish, and butter chicken into a separate dish.<br />
                                    7 Serve butter chicken and cauliflower rice with steamed vegetables or a salad.</p></span>

                                <h5>Fried Rice</h5>
                                <span><p>1 Place onion or spring onions and garlic into Thermomix bowl and chop 4 sec/sp 5. Remove to Varoma dish.<br />
                        2 Place eggs into bowl and mix 5 sec/sp 3. Line Varoma tray with a large piece of wet baking paper (so that paper overlaps sides of tray approx. 2 cm) and pour eggs into tray. Set aside.<br />
                        3 Rinse bowl. Weigh coconut milk and water into bowl and place lid on top.<br />
                        4 Place rice basket on top of lid, and weigh the rice into the basket. Rinse well under running water, then insert basket into bowl.<br />
                        5 Place Varoma into position, and start cooking - 20 mins (basmati) or 35 mins (brown)/Varoma temp/sp 4.<br />
                        6 While rice begins cooking, chop up meat and/or veges, placing it into the Varoma as you go, harder veges and meat on the bottom, softer veges and nut/seeds on top. (The steam will not begin cooking what's in the Varoma until about 10 mins into cooking time, so you have time to get it all in the dish before then. Replace Varoma lid after each addition.)<br />
                        7 Check after 20 mins to see if everything is cooked. (With brown rice, just add the veges and eggs when there's only 15 minutes left to go, so they don't overcook.)<br />
                        8 Remove Varoma and place lid underneath.  Remove rice basket using spatula, and tip rice into Varoma bowl.  Add the meat and veges. Slice the egg up in tray (see photo below) and tip into Varoma bowl with rice.  Season with some tamari sauce / soy sauce / sweet chilli sauce, mix together gently, and serve!</p></span>
